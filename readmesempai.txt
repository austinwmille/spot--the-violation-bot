** note for myself: use python version 3.9
** note for others: as long as the requirements are installed probably just use whatever version you want >= 3.8

This bot uses a virtual audio cable to route the audio output from my music app to a discord bot

If it noticed that spotify is playing, it joins voice channels, and streams the music to the channel. It also uses ChatGPT api calls for conversation AND for recognizing which command the user wants to use.

It isn't perfect. this is a rough draft fourth draft), but it works!

the script makes use of ffmpeg, and a virtual audio device app.

We're working on it...
