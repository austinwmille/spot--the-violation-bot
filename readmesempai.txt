This bot uses a virtual audio cable to route the audio output from my music app to a discord bot

It joins a voice channel with you, and plays the music.

It isn't perfect. this is a rough draft (second draft), but it works!

the script makes use of ffmpeg, and a virtual audio device app.

it still has to buffer every minute or so, so it skips for a fraction of a second, but we can fix this later
